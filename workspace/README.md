This directory contains all AI-assisted development artifacts for the Flux project.

## Structure

```
/ai
├── notes/          # Session notes, insights, observations
├── plans/          # Planning documents, architecture decisions
├── prds/           # Product requirement documents
├── logs/           # Session logs, interaction history
├── sessions/       # Session handoffs and continuity docs
└── README.md       # This file
```

## Purpose

This workspace captures the collaboration between human and AI during Flux development:

- **Notes**: Thoughts, insights, design discussions
- **Plans**: Architecture decisions, implementation strategies
- **PRDs**: Formal product requirement documents
- **Logs**: Timestamped interaction logs
- **Sessions**: Handoff documents for session continuity

## Philosophy

Flux is homecooked personal software. This `/ai` workspace makes the invisible work of AI collaboration visible—documenting decisions, preserving context, and enabling continuity across sessions.

## Usage

All AI collaboration artifacts should be stored here, not scattered across external systems. This keeps the project self-contained and the development narrative intact.
